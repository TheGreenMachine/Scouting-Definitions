/**
 * This class provides access to various
 * database implementations. It provides the necessary functions
 * to query and modify database values.
 * <br/>
 * Implementing a {@link Database} should be done carefully. All
 * {@link Database} implementations must behave in the same way and must
 * follow all method contracts.
 * <br/>
 * Database objects are expected to adhere to the
 * <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID>ACID</a> principles.
 * <h3>Database Metadata</h3>
 * To retrieve a list of all currently defined tables, query
 * the {@code @tables} metatable. Its results will have
 * an {@link com.edinarobotics.scouting.definitions.database.types.Integer Integer}
 * primary key value (the database table id number) and a 
 * {@link com.edinarobotics.scouting.definitions.database.types.Text Text}
 * table name in the {@code tid} and {@code tname} columns respectively.
 * <br/><br/>
 * To retrieve schema information for a table, query the {@code @schema}
 * metatable. The results will have an
 * {@link com.edinarobotics.scouting.definitions.database.types.Integer Integer}
 * column primary key id value, an
 * {@link com.edinarobotics.scouting.definitions.database.types.IntegerForeignKey IntegerForeignKey}
 * value pointing to the table id from the {@code @tables} metatable and
 * a {@link com.edinarobotics.scouting.definitions.database.types.Text Text}
 * value defining the type of the column.<br/>
 * Possible type values are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code blob}</li>
 * <li>{@code boolean}</li>
 * <li>{@code integer}</li>
 * <li>{@code integer foreign key <table reference string>}</li>
 * <li>{@code integer primary key}</li>
 * <li>{@code real}</li>
 * <li>{@code text}</li>
 * </ul>
 * These values will be in the {@code cid}, {@code tid} and {@code ctype}
 * columns respectively. The results will include the schemas of the
 * {@code @tables} and {@code @schema} metatables.
 * The same information can also
 * be retrieved by sampling a {@link Row} from a table and consulting its
 * {@link Column} objects' types.
